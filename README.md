# Food Delivery Project


The aim of this project is to build a responsive online application for restaurant which helps customers to order food online. With this method, food is ordered online and delivered to the customer. 

This is made possible through the use of electronic payment system. Customers pay with their credit cards or can pay either through cash when are served. So, the system designed in this project will enable customers go online and place order for their food.
